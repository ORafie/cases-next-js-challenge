# Next.js cases challenge

Welcome! Glad to see you interested in working with scribit.pro. Below, you'll find the description of an exercise that
is very close to the kind of work you'll be doing on a day-to-day basis.

The exercise is for us to get a feeling on how you typically work: what kind of decisions did you make? How would you
approach X or Y? What's a priority for you when building something?

There is no perfect answer, nor should this exercise eat up all your free time. Don't sweat it if you can't make it all
work within 4 to 6 hours.

## What are we building?

Our website is an important first impression for potential customers. The site tells introduces the platform for making
videos accessible and tells you our story around accessibility online.
Check it out at: [https://scribit.pro](https://scribit.pro).

To inspire potential new customers and to share our previous successes we're introducing "cases" to our website. The
design on how we want this to look is shown below:

It is our task to build the overview page of the blogposts. To put things more concrete. These things are in-scope:

- A masonry lay-out of recent cases
- Each case is a card with a title, author, category (expert or case) and optional image
    - authors have a name and company name

The following things are out-of-scope as they are already developed:

- The hero section (Read cases from our...)
- Anything above the described hero: topbar navigation, company logo etc
- Pagination
- Anything below the pagination: swirl, footer, footer links etc.


## Technical constraints

Due to our current tech-stack, we are hoping you could deliver the solution using:

1. React with Typescript

2. [Material UI](https://mui.com/) as the basis for your components

3. Code-style should adhere to our eslint config

4. Components should be responsive and re-usable
